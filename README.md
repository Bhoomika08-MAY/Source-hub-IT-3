# 🎓 College Info Assistant – Your Smart Campus Guide

An interactive, voice-enabled chatbot built using Python and Tkinter. This assistant helps users explore college-related information such as admissions, courses, fees, placements, and more. Designed with a modern GUI, rule-based logic, and voice support.



## 💡 Why College Info?

I chose **college information** as the use case because it's one of the most **frequently asked and practical topics** in real life. Students, parents, and applicants constantly seek answers about admissions, fees, placements, and facilities—making it the perfect domain for a rule-based chatbot. This project simulates how a campus helpdesk assistant could work, offering quick, reliable responses without needing AI models or internet access.



## ✨ Features

- 💬 **Rule-Based Responses** using keyword matching (`if-elif-else`)
- 🎙️ **Voice Input** powered by SpeechRecognition and Google Speech API
- 🔊 **Voice Output** using pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
- 🖼️ **Modern GUI** with dark theme, styled buttons, and emoji-rich replies
- 📚 **Predefined Categories**: Admission, Courses, Fees, Placement, Facilities, Contact
- 🎤 **Visible Mic Button** styled for clarity and accessibility
- 🧠 **Keyword Flexibility**: Handles variations like "fee", "fees", "campus", etc.
